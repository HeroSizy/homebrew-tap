  caveats <<~EOS
    MyTwig is not signed with an Apple Developer ID and not notarized by
    Apple (it has an ad-hoc signature only). Homebrew marks the download as
    quarantined, as a browser does, so macOS blocks its first launch:

      macOS 15 and later: open MyTwig, click Done, then go to
        System Settings > Privacy & Security and click Open Anyway.
      macOS 12 to 14: Control-click MyTwig in Applications, choose Open,
        then click Open.

    This may be needed again after `brew upgrade`, which downloads a new copy.

    MyTwig also updates itself from its own signed releases. Homebrew then
    keeps listing the version it installed; `brew upgrade --cask mytwig`
    brings it up to date.
